# ExpandingGrids
An expanding grid setup to simulate the multiscale nature of atmospheric convection.  

This code was used to produce the results in "Expanding Grids for Efficient Cloud Dynamics Simulations Across Scales," a paper which was coauthored with S.N. Stechmann.

To compile the code: make smr_test

To rune the code: ./smr_test
